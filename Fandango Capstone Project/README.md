# Fandango Capstone project

If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

Let's refer to this article: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/

The article mentions how the Fandango website was rating the movies slightly higher than their real rating. In this project we are going to compare the Fandango's movie ratings with the ratings of other rating websites - Rotten Tomatoes, Meta and IMDB.
