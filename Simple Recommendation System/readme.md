## Approaches Implemented

1. **Popularity-Based Recommender**: This approach recommends movies based on their overall popularity among users. It suggests popular movies regardless of user preferences.
2. **Content-Based Recommender**: This approach recommends movies similar to a given movie based on genre.
3. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: This approach recommends movies to a user based on similar users' preferences. It calculates the cosine similarity between users' ratings and suggests movies liked by similar users.
4. **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**: This approach recommends movies similar to those previously liked by a user. It calculates the cosine similarity between movies based on user ratings and suggests similar movies to those the user has rated highly.
